# Wallet Tutorial for Polkadot.Study

In this tutorial, we create a basic polkadot wallet by building the necessary components for a web application using React with Typescript and the Polkadot-js API. These components include functions such as creating the keys for an address with a graphical interface, adding an existing seed phrase, how to check balances and transfer tokens using the Polkadot.js extension for signing.

This tutorial is intended to enable the reader to understand the usage and features available in the Polkadot.js API and how to integrate new GUI components for a wallet web application into your react-based projects with the typescript template.
